initial values: 0.83, 1.25
this will be called the (unreduced) established configuration.

this will be called the (reduced) established configuration.

Results:
A kappa1 of >= 0.3 results in smooth nearly monotonic convergence to an equilibrium state.
The convergence seems truly monotonic for at least kappa1 >= 0.8.
The equilibrium value for x increases with kappa1 according to the formula x_equi = kappa1 / 0.3.
The equilibrium value for y decreases with kappa1 in a sort-of-inversely proportional way.
The equation for the derivative of y shows that y_equi = 1 / x_equi = 0.3 / kappa_1.
Yes, this means that (1, 1) is indeed an equilibrium solution in the case kappa1 = kappa2 = 0.3.
In the case kappa1 = 0, x falls monotonically to or towards 0 and y rises to around or about 1.5.
In all these cases, x and y are indistinguishable from their limits before t = 20.
However, it is clear that the convergence gets quicker as kappa1 is lowered,
though the relation between rate of convergence and kappa1's value is unclear.
For kappa1 in {0.1, 0.2}, some form of periodic behavior occurs.
Notably, the graphed peak magnitude does not appear to be constant,
though this may be an issue with the "granularity" of our simulation,
i.e. the number of points at which the simulated state was saved.
A cursory look suggests the period of oscillation may decrease as kappa1 increases,
but this is by no means certain.
Similarly, the amplitude of the oscillations may decrease with kappa1.
We will further investigate these oscillations, and other behavior, next.
We note that we should decrease the number of interpolated values for kappa1,
or risk getting a jumbled mess of similarly colored wave curves,
without being able to glean anything from them other than maybe one or two general trends.
