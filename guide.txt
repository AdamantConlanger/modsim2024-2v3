Just create a venv with
> py -3.12 -m venv .venv
> .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
or, if you're using command prompt:
> .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

then install the packages with
> py -m pip install -U pip
> py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

and then run any of the files with "choose" at the end.
All of the files are in the "verslag_eindversies" folder.
(The one you'll probably want is single_run_choose.py,
because it makes graphs for single simulations.
multiple_runs_choose.py does multiple simulations in a single graph.
contours_just_vis_choose.py is the one you'll want for visualizing
the contour graphs that are pre-simulated;
simulating everything for those graphs takes hours.)
You'll be asked what model you want to use.
The names are explained in the "explanation_of_abbreviations.txt" file.
The most important ones are:
stu (unreduced basic model with only x and y),
ctu (idem for extended model),
str (reduced basic model),
ctr (idem for extended model).
If you want to edit the settings and configuration for a simulation,
you'll have to go to the designated folder and file and edit it there.

Alternatively, you can use the multiple_runs_better.py files
in the individual folders. They have a different color choosing
approach, though. To run these files,
just go to the file itself and run it, instead of using a
"choose" file.

Alternatively, you can use the "single_run.py" file
in the "voorbeeldcode" folder, which does everything
very simply. But it only works for one model.
